Installation
------------

Install the library including all dependencies with.

::

  pip install -e ".[test,visualization,ssm_gpy,ssm_pytorch]"
  
  
`test` for the testing tools. `visualization` for visualizations such as matplotlib. `ssm_gpy` and `ssm_pytorch` for state space models based on `GPy` or `PyTorch`, respectively.

Experiments can be run using the `experiments/run.py` script.

Test can be run using pytest. There are also more sophisticated style tests in 
`scripts/test_code.sh`.
